# Proposal 0.1 - Mobile App

Creation of Mobile App with Android Studio using Kotlin
- Transmit to Raspberry Pi server
    - Communicate User Input
    - Communicate other properties, user location using GPS

- Receive from Raspberry Pi server
    - Display Information from server
    - Generate notifications for user upon events
    - 

Concern with mobile app is dev time/ taking time away from python component, but would project much more convenient/accessible from user standpoint considering how phones are used today, pretty much kept on the person at all times

Mobile App makes things much much easier inputwise, rather than a GUI from desktop

If time permits, can actually use the mobile app during the presentation, depends on how much time/technical work is done

# Proposal 1 - Home Automation / Smart Home

Features
- Window/Curtain Control
- Lighting Control
    - Mood lights etc
    - 
- Use of Mobile App if created, much more accessible/convenient for user , instead of some touch panel etc
- Smart doorbell, allows user to view deliveries even if not at home, manually open the door/ensure that the doorman doesnt steal stuff etc

System Diagram:

Hardware Requirements:
- Camera for smart doorbell/ views of house
- Raspberry Pi
- Motor for mechanism etc
- Have some linear actuators, can use them to simulate curtains etc
    - Curtains open/close depending on time of day, or user input
    - Curtains can open/close depending on what user is doing, watching movies etc


Personal Opinion:

Not very creative/ but room for many features but not 







# Proposal 2 - Smart Toilet

User can feedback cleanliness of toilet/ notify maintenance if their presence is required:
- Toilet not flushing properly, flooding, wet floor etc




- Use of mobile app to guide maintenance staff
    - Alternatively, staff route can be pre-planned from data 

# Proposal 3 - Smart Car Park

- Track the number of cars, track where the cars park etc, can be used to collect data for future car park planning

Can take a page from barrier free carparks, removes time taken at barriers at entry/exit
    - can do some math on how long it takes, will save loads of manhours, considering maybe a 15-30s each time, longer when there are hiccups

Possible issues would be the lack of actual hardware, the in-vehicle unit to deduct parking charges

# Proposal 4 - Smart Dustbin/Recycling

Use ultrasonic sensor or something to keep track of capacity/ when will be required to be emptied. 

Once triggered, cleaning personnel can be sent to pick up the trash, replace bin liner

Reduces manpower/makes manpower more efficient

Can be used for trash/trucks as well

- Use of OPENCV:
    - Use OpenCV to detect whether items are actually 

# Proposal 5

Baby monitoring system lmao





# Proposal 6 - Smart Greenhouse

Really boring but very practical





# Questions for Mr Chong:
- Possible to run on own hardware/raspberry pi? Compared to
- Availability of other hardware apart from kits? Guessing little to none? Anything outsided of the kit hardware will have to provided on our own?
- We're looking for a minimum viable prototype? So use motor to "emulate" mechanisms such as curtain motors etc?
- Do we need to reinvent the wheel? Or just make a very slick implementation of a basic idea?



# Presentation Component 20%

- Has the team done good research & analysis to understand user needs?
    - Trends
        - Home 
            - Work from home due to COVID, with COVID being an endemic 
            - Increased home purchases due to online shopping increase, more online e-commerce websites
        - F

- Has the team shown that the project is feasible with the block diagram, flowchart, data flow diagram & Gantt chart?
    - Flowchart
        - How user input/events translate into actions
        - 

    - Data flow diagram
        - 

    - Block Diagram
        - Connections of devices / network

    - Gantt Chart
        - Overview of Work to be done
            - Pre-planning
            - Procurement of parts
            - Technical Work, Design / Implementation
            
    - Feasibility Matrix
        - Evaluation of multiple ideas
            - Probably do after initial idea generation/proposal

    - Mobile
        - If mobile app is created, create a placeholder storyboard-ish, placeholder buttons and texts that dont need to work but show possible layouts
        - If mobile can show how ubiquitous the phone has become in daily life, pretty much everyone has one on their person
            - Can do some stats or something with it
            - Maybe Singaporean numbers or something
            

- Has the team come up with a creative idea / solution to the userâ€™s problem? 
    - Problematic part
        - Reinvent the wheel? Make it very slick? Does the idea even need to be the one we finally make

- Is the presentation lively & engaging?
    - Refer to example given
