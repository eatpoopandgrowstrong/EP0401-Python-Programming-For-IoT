# Stuff to Prep for Darren





Software:
- Python
    - 3.9, maybe not 3.10, think matplotlib do not have support for it yet

- Python modules/libraries
    - Basic Ones, if not installed view "How to install"
        - Matplotlib
        - Numpy
        - Pandas

    - Would be nice to haves


## How to view modules?
- Go to cmd prompt and type pip list

## How to install? 

1. Go to cmd prompt
2. type 
```
pip install modulenamehere
```
3. wait

### Example:

if no numpy

```
pip install numpy

```
