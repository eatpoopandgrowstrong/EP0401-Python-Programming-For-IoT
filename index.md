# Proposal 0.1 - Mobile App

Creation of Mobile App with Android Studio using Kotlin
- Transmit to Raspberry Pi server
    - Communicate User Input
    - Communicate other properties, user location using GPS

- Receive from Raspberry Pi server
    - Display Information from server
    - Generate notifications for user upon events
    - 



# Proposal 1 - Home Automation / Smart Home

Features
- 
- 

Hardware Requirements:
- Camera
- Raspberry Pi
- Motor for mechanism etc
- Have some linear actuators, can use them to simulate curtains etc
    - Curtains open/close depending on time of day, or user input
    - Curtains can open/close depending on what user is doing, watching movies etc


Personal Opinion:

Standard    







# Proposal 2 - Smart Toilet

User can feedback cleanliness of toilet/ notify maintenance if their presence is required:
- Toilet not flushing properly, flooding, wet floor etc




# Proposal 3 - Smart Car Park

- Track the number of cars, track where the cars park etc, can be used to collect data for future car park planning


# Proposal 4 - Smart Dustbin/Recycling

Use ultrasonic sensor or something to keep track of capacity/ when will be required to be emptied. 
Once triggered, cleaning personnel can be sent to pick up the trash, replace bin liner
Reduces manpower/makes manpower more efficient





# Questions for Mr Chong:
- Possible to run on own hardware/raspberry pi? Compared to
- Availability of other hardware apart from kits? Guessing little to none? Anything outsided of the kit hardware will have to provided on our own?
- We're looking for a minimum viable prototype? So use 


Presentation Component 20%
- Has the team done good research & analysis to understand user needs?
    - Trends
        - Home 
            - Work from home due to COVID, with COVID being an endemic 
            - Increased home purchases due to online shopping increase, more online e-commerce websites
        - F

- Has the team shown that the project is feasible with the block diagram, flowchart, data flow diagram & Gantt chart?
    - Flowchart
        - How user input/events translate into actions
        - 
    - Data flow diagram
        - 
    - Block Diagram
        - Connections of devices / network
    - Gantt Chart
        - Overview of Work to be done
            - Pre-planning
            - Procurement of parts
            - Technical Work, Design / Implementation

    - Feasibility Matrix
        - Evaluation of multiple ideas
            - Probably do after initial idea generation/proposal

    - Mobile
        - If mobile app is created, create a placeholder storyboard-ish, placeholder buttons and texts that dont need to work but show possible layouts
        - If mobile can show how ubiquitous the phone has become in daily life, pretty much everyone has one on their person
            - Can do some stats or something with it
            - Maybe Singaporean numbers or something
            

- Has the team come up with a creative idea / solution to the userâ€™s problem? 
    - Problematic part
        - Reinvent the wheel? Make it very slick? Does the idea even need to be the one we finally make

- Is the presentation lively & engaging?
    - Refer to example given
