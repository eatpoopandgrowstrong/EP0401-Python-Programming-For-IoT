# Proposal 0.1 - Mobile App

Creation of Mobile App with Android Studio using Kotlin
- Transmit to Raspberry Pi server
    - Communicate User Input
    - Communicate other properties, user location using GPS

- Receive from Raspberry Pi server
    - Display Information from server
    - Generate notifications for user upon events
    - 

Concern with mobile app is dev time/ taking time away from python component, but would project much more convenient/accessible from user standpoint considering how phones are used today, pretty much kept on the person at all times


# Proposal 1 - Home Automation / Smart Home

Features
- Window/Curtain Control
- Lighting Control
    - Mood lights etc
    - 
- Use of Mobile App if created, much more accessible/convenient for user , instead of some touch panel etc
- Smart doorbell, allows user to view deliveries even if not at home, manually open the door/ensure that the doorman doesnt steal stuff etc



Hardware Requirements:
- Camera for smart doorbell/ views of house
- Raspberry Pi
- Motor for mechanism etc
- Have some linear actuators, can use them to simulate curtains etc
    - Curtains open/close depending on time of day, or user input
    - Curtains can open/close depending on what user is doing, watching movies etc


Personal Opinion:

Not very creative/ but room for many features but not 







# Proposal 2 - Smart Toilet

User can feedback cleanliness of toilet/ notify maintenance if their presence is required:
- Toilet not flushing properly, flooding, wet floor etc




- Use of mobile app to guide maintenance staff
    - Alternatively, staff route can be pre-planned from data 

# Proposal 3 - Smart Car Park

- Track the number of cars, track where the cars park etc, can be used to collect data for future car park planning

Can take a page from barrier free carparks, removes time taken at barriers at entry/exit
    - can do some math on how long it takes, will save loads of manhours, considering maybe a 15-30s each time, longer when there are hiccups

Possible issues would be the lack of actual hardware, the in-vehicle unit to deduct parking charges

# Proposal 4 - Smart Dustbin/Recycling

Use ultrasonic sensor or something to keep track of capacity/ when will be required to be emptied. 

Once triggered, cleaning personnel can be sent to pick up the trash, replace bin liner

Reduces manpower/makes manpower more efficient

Can be used for trash/trucks as well

- Use of OPENCV:
    - Use OpenCV to detect whether items are actually 

# Proposal 5

Baby monitoring system lmao





# Proposal 6 - Smart Greenhouse

Really boring but very practical





# Questions for Mr Chong:
- Possible to run on own hardware/raspberry pi? Compared to
- Availability of other hardware apart from kits? Guessing little to none? Anything outsided of the kit hardware will have to provided on our own?
- We're looking for a minimum viable prototype? So use motor to "emulate" mechanisms such as curtain motors etc?
- Do we need to reinvent the wheel? Or just make a very slick implementation of a basic idea?



# Presentation Component 20%

- Has the team done good research & analysis to understand user needs?
    - Trends
