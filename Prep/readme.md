# Stuff to Prep for Darren

Software:
- Python
    - 3.9, maybe not 3.10, think matplotlib do not have support for it yet

- Python modules/libraries
    - Basic Ones, if not installed view "How to install"
        - Matplotlib
        - Numpy
        - Pandas

    - Would be nice to haves

- Editors:
    - Personal Preference, try both, feel free to explore others
        - Visual Studio Code
        - Spyder

- 

Hardware:
- Maybe webcam etc if opencv
- Breadboarding? For testing only, will be pretty jank if final


## How to view modules?
- Go to cmd prompt and type pip list

## How to install? 

1. Go to cmd prompt
2. type 
```
pip install modulenamehere
```
3. wait

### Example:

if no numpy

```
pip install numpy

```

Reading:

PEP8, for standardisation of coding format

This is Python, so we use snake case here
